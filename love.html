        I have spent innumerable hours thinking of what to do. How to show the
        love I hold for you. How to let you feel the love I have for you. And
        even now, it feels like it's not enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you, my hubby.
        <br />
        I love you more than I could ever imagine.
        <br />
        I love you more than I ever thought possible.
        <br />
        I love you so much that I forgot what it's like to not love you.
        <br />
        My love, my star, my soul, my life. The love of my life, my lovey, my
        husband.
        <br />
        I love you all of the much.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I don't know if this will be enough. I don't even know if it'll be
        decent. But I'm doing my best to show you just how much I love you. And
        I truly wish I could give you everything you deserve. This, me, this
        life. You deserve so much more. And I will do my best everyday to grant
        you that and so much more. Because I love you. And I love being loved by
        you.
